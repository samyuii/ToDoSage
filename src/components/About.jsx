                <p className="text-lg mb-2">
                    For the best experience, we recommend using TodoSage  in a modern, up-to-date browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. Different browsers might handle local storage and JavaScript differently, which can affect how your tasks are saved and displayed.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg mb-2">
                    TodoSage  relies on <strong>local storage</strong> to keep your to-do list persistent between sessions. Local storage is a feature of web browsers that allows the application to store data on your device. This means that your tasks, descriptions, due dates, and completed statuses are saved even when you close or refresh the browser.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg mb-2">
                    By using TodoSage  in a single, consistent browser, you ensure that all your to-do data is properly saved and synchronized. Switching between browsers or clearing your local storage might lead to data loss, so it&apos;s best to stick with one browser for managing your tasks.
